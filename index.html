          <h1>About</h1>
          Michael Font founded New Harbor Development with the mission to create safe harbors for opportunity to set sail.
          <p>
          Michael learned the investor's perspective as a Development Specialist at the National Affordable Housing Trust, a national non-profit tax credit syndicator. He gained the developer and owner perspective as the Development Director of Homes for America, a premier non-profit developer.
          <p>
          In these roles, Michael developed the skills to take a project from concept to completion, and hopes to use his experience to create new developments and provide similarly aligned organizations with advisory and consulting services.

          Michael has a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and a minor in Environmental Studies from Dartmouth College.
